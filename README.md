# everiToken - World's First Token-customized Public Chain for Token Economy and for Everyone

![Build Status](https://codebuild.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiTFFYVEF1UDVXaVZrWGNUOVlKSnphcElOMFBzZUFjZ0QwZHpoNCtseVdFdTVoa3hHeWpOQ1ZzWk51bUVHTXlIRjk4Z1d4UFJrUmVyQ2xVaWhHSkxabURJPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6IkFIWFJNOHZsVjZGOThuVzQiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)

Welcome to the everiToken source code repository!

everiToken public chain is developed and maintained by everiToken Team. It is built on earlier work on eos by EOSIO (https://github.com/EOSIO/eos).

This code is currently alpha-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do. This includes running a private single node test network and issue and transfer tokens in domains.

There is no public testnet running currently.

## Supported Operating Systems
everiToken currently supports the following operating systems:  
1. Amazon 2017.09 and higher
2. Centos 7
