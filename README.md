# everiToken - World's First Token-customized Public Chain for Token Economy and for Everyone

Welcome to the everiToken source code repository!

everiToken public chain is developed and maintained by everiToken Team. It is built on earlier work on eos by EOSIO (https://github.com/EOSIO/eos).

This code is currently alpha-quality and under rapid development. That said, there is plenty early experimenters can do. This includes running a private single node test network and issue and transfer tokens in domains.

There is no public testnet running currently.

## Supported Operating Systems
everiToken currently supports the following operating systems:  
1. Amazon 2017.09 and higher
2. Centos 7
3. Fedora 25 and higher (Fedora 27 recommended)
4. Mint 18
5. Ubuntu 16.04 and higher
6. MacOS Darwin 10.12 and higher (MacOS 10.13.x recommended)
